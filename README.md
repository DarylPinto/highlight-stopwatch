# highlight-stopwatch
Mark down the best moments of your videos while you record them!

##Why?
I've been making YouTube videos for a while now, and I've always found it frustrating having to watch through an entire recording just to find the funniest/most important parts. I'd always wished I could just save timestamps whenever something interesting happened to make the editing process a  easier, so I made this program to fulfill that need.

##How to use
1) Set your screen capture software's hotkey to `Shift + Page Up`
2) Run Highlight Stopwatch before you start recording
3) Set the folder in Highlight Stopwatch to the same one that you're recording your video to
4) Start recording your video with `Shift + Page Up`. This will also start the stopwatch
5) Everytime you press `Page Down` you *highlight* the current timestamp.
6) When you're done recording press `Shift + Page Up` again. Your recording will finish, and highlight stopwatch will output a `.txt` file with a list of all the timestamps that you highlighted!

When editing you'll now have a handy list of the best moments for each video file.
