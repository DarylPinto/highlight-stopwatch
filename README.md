# Highlight Stopwatch
Mark down the best moments of your videos while you record them!

## Why?
So, I've been making YouTube videos for a while now, and the most frustrating part of the process is having to watch through an entire recording just to find the funniest/most important parts. I've always wished I could just save timestamps whenever something interesting happened to smooth out the editing process, so I made this program to fulfill that need.

Also, I thought it would be fun to try out Electon.

## How to
1. Set your screen capture hotkey (in the program of your choice) to `Shift + Page Up`
2. Open Highlight Stopwatch and set the folder to the same one that you're recording your video to
3. When you begin recording with `Shift + Page Up`, Highlight Stopwatch will also start
4. Anytime something interesting happens press `Page Down` to *highlight* the current timestamp
5. When you're done recording press `Shift + Page Up` to end your screen capture and output a `.txt` file with a list of all the timestamps that you highlighted!

Now you'll have a handy list of all the important timestamps for every video file. Time to cut down on re-watching and focus on the editing itself!
